# Neon Skylines

This is a minecraft shader which adds customizable edges to blocks and entities. Things are split into categories so edge colors can help you to better distinguish what you're looking at.

# TODO:

- depth fall off setting so edges fade out the further they are
  - seperate per detection type (color, depth, norm)?
  - reverse fall off toggle
- Better weather edge handling
- Entity and DH sensitivity multipliers for light and normals
- Helmet overlay (low priority)
